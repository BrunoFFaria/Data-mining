# Data Mining algorithms
In this repository the well known data mining algorithms, support vector machines and random forests, are implemented in javascript. 
Both algorithms implement only the minimal set of extensions for classification and can be appreciated working on http://biplabaveiro.x10host.com/?a=applet. I intend to add more features in the future, such as out-of bag estimation, error-handling, probability calculation, etc. However, for now this provides the necessary details for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge in these well known data-mining tools.

If you intend to test the demo, the files should be supplied as comma separated values (csv format) where each column has an header identifying the type of observation. The last column should be the category of the observation. i.e. 

var1 | var2 | class
--- | --- | ---
*dummy observation 1* | *dummy observation 1* | **dummy category 1**
*dummy observation 2* | *dummy observation 2* | **dummy category 2**
1 | 2 | 3
