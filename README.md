# Data Mining algorithms
In this repository the well known data mining algorithms, support vector machines and random forests, are implemented in javascript. 
Both algorithms implement only the minimal set of extensions for classification and can be appreciated working on http://biplabaveiro.x10host.com/?a=applet. I intend to add more features in the future, such as out-of bag estimation, error-handling, probability calculation, etc. 
However, for now this provides the necessary details for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge in these well known data-mining toolds.
